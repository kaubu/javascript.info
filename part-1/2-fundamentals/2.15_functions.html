    // Is else required? The function will NOT work differently; else is not

    /* 
    Rewrite the function using '?' or '||' importance: 4

    The following function returns true if the parameter age is greater than
    18.

    Otherwise it asks for a confirmation and returns its result.

        function checkAge(age) {
        if (age > 18) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return confirm('Did parents allow you?');
        }
        }

    Rewrite it, to perform the same, but without if, in a single line.

    Make two variants of checkAge:

        Using a question mark operator ?
        Using OR ||
    */

    function checkAgeA(age) {
        return (age > 18) ? true : confirm("Did your parents allow you?");
    }

    function checkAgeB(age) {
      return (age > 18) || confirm("Did your parents allow you?");
    }

    // alert(checkAgeB(20)); alert(checkAgeB(13));

    // Working and correct



    /* 
    Function min(a, b) importance: 1

    Write a function min(a,b) which returns the least of two numbers a and b.

    For instance:

    min(2, 5) == 2 min(3, -1) == -1 min(1, 1) == 1
    */

    function min(a, b) {
      if (a < b) {
        return a;
      } else { // covers both (a > b) and (a == b)
        return b;
      }
    }

    // alert(min(2,5)); alert(min(3,-1)); alert(min(1,1)); 2, -1, 1 Working and
    // correct, however a more elegant solution presents itself using the
    // question mark operator
    /* 
    function min(a, b) { return (a < b) ? a : b;
    }
    */



    /* 
    Function pow(x,n) importance: 4

    Write a function pow(x,n) that returns x in power n. Or, in other words,
    multiplies x by itself n times and returns the result.

    pow(3, 2) = 3 * 3 = 9
    pow(3, 3) = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27
    pow(1, 100) = 1 * 1 * ...* 1 = 1

    Create a web-page that prompts for x and n, and then shows the result of
    pow(x,n).

    Run the demo

    P.S. In this task the function should support only natural values of n:
    integers up from 1.
    */

    function pow(x, n) {
      if (n < 1) return 0; // n must be above 1
      // can't check for integers yet, I don't know how
      return x ** n;
    }

    let base = prompt("Base?", "");
    let exponent = prompt("Exponent?", "");
    alert(`Result: ${pow(base, exponent)}`);

    // Working correctly, and elegant if I do say so myself.
    
    // Not exactly the official solution though. The official solution
    // presupposes that you haven't learnt about the ** operator yet. It seems
    // it was that way in the past, but right now I already knew about it. You
    // were supposed to achieve it via loops. I did not. Also I should've
    // checked for whether or not the number was above 1 outside of the
    // function, as the function should only do as the function is meant to.
