// Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90 inclusively.

// Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one â€“ without it.

if (!(age >= 14) && !(age <= 90)) {}
// if (!(age >= 14 && age <= 90))

if (age <= 14 || age >= 90) {}
// if (age < 14 || age > 90)

// so it seems my first was probably correct, but my second definitely not so
